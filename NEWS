udisks 1.0.5
------------

udisks provides a daemon, D-Bus API and command line tools
for managing disks and storage devices.

All releases in the udisks 1.0 series will retain ABI compatibility at
the D-Bus interface level. This means that any application built
against udisks 1.0.x will work with udisks 1.0.y provided that y >=
x. At this point we do not provide any ABI guarantees for the
udisks(1) command-line tool (neither options nor the name). See the
README file for more discussion of ABI guarantees.

This version fixes a security vulnerability (CVE-2014-0004), so please update
as soon as possible!

Changes from udisks 1.0.4:

Brice De Bruyne (1):
      Fix segfault and detection for SATA-II RAID controller

David Zeuthen (2):
      udisks-daemon: Add --no-debug option and use this for D-Bus activation
      Bug 51439 – udisks should hide lvm PVs

Edward Sheldrake (1):
      Fix power/level deprecation kernel warning

Martin Pitt (9):
      Fix buffer overflow in mount path parsing. If users have the possibility
      to create very long mount points, such as with FUSE, they could cause
      udisksd to crash, or even to run arbitrary code as root with specially
      crafted mount paths. [CVE-2014-0004]

      tests/run: Fix crash if first hard disk is not SMART capable
      Add some safe and useful ntfs-3g allowed mount options
      Drop deprecated g_io_channel_seek()
      test suite: Fix test_swap to not expect successful fsck
      test suite: Fix test_reiserfs for current reiserfsprogs
      Bug 48173 — Ignore add/change events for a nonexisting native path
      Mark rts_bpp devices as SD card readers

Tom Gundersen (1):
      add systemd service file and dbus activation to the udisks1 branch

udisks 1.0.1

README file for more discussion of ABI guarantees.

ATTENTION: This release fixes a local information disclosure: The
device-mapper udev prober exposed the plaintext password of encrypted
LUKS devices as an udev property "UDISKS_DM_TARGETS_PARAMS", which all
local users can read without restriction. (CVE-2010-1149) The only
affected version is udisks 1.0.0 (it was introduced in commit 2f0154);
No release of DeviceKit-Disks is affected. See fdo #27494 for more
details.

DeviceKit-disks 004
-------------------

DeviceKit-disks is a daemon that provide interfaces to obtain
information and perform operations on storage devices.

NOTE NOTE NOTE: This is an unstable release of DeviceKit-disks, all
                API is subject to change.

David Zeuthen (54):
      use dev_t to identify mounts, not device files
      allow users with appropriate authorizations to unmount all fstab mounts
      add a --dump option to devkit-disks(1)
      only export holders/slaves if the devices are in our db
      only use a single PolicyKit action for Linux MD operations
      add newline for debug message
      export all linux-md raid devices (except ones marked as 'clear')
      avoid taking action if a component is removed from an array
      rework default mount options
      don't poll SATA AN drives
      fix up how device-is-system-internal is computed
      port to libatasmart
      forgot to add ATA SMART prober in last commit
      if BLKRRPART fails with EBUSY, just try a few more times
      allow job-num-tasks to be 0 (meaning "unknown")
      ensure a MS-DOS extended partition is busy if logical partitions are busy
      rework partition table handling
      print the scheme of the main partition table, never the nested one
      use /proc/self/mountinfo and handle a device being mounted in multiple pla
      export device-major and device-minor properties
      remove device-is-busy property
      remove a lot of unnecessary errors
      remove erase= option and the notion of tasks within jobs
      rework some of the ATA SMART stuff, go back to using sqlite
      fix udev rules to keep udev from complaining
      prefix all D-Bus objects paths with /org/freedesktop/DeviceKit/Disks
      add FindDeviceByMajorMinor() to look up a device by dev_t
      also move umount.devkit over to use the correct object paths
      change devkit-disks(1) to use device node paths instead of object paths
      install udev rules into /lib/udev/rules.d not /etc/udev/rules.d
      fix grammar/spelling for ATA SMART output in devkit-disks(1)
      remove debug spew from mount monitor
      remove hack for working around broken USB card reader
      use /var/run/DeviceKit-disks, not /tmp as a temporary directory
      bump version
      fix a race where /etc/fstab mount points where sometimes removed
      change default mount options for vfat to utf8=1 and shortname=lower
      fix some bugs in the man page
      add command line options to devkit-disks for refreshing ATA SMART data
      use correct dmode for iso9660 mounts
      also check if partitions on a device is busy
      remove debug spew
      add temporary workaround for btrfs
      rework how we detect whether a device is busy
      be more careful when probing for ATA SMART
      add device-presentation-hide property
      document influential udev properties in the DeviceKit-disks man page
      add property device-detection-time
      fix up some warnings
      allow the 'flush' mount option for vfat
      properly detect devices with vfat on the whole disk
      add support for ext2
      add :device-media-detection-time property
      only consider Prefail attibutes when checking for bad attributes

Matthias Clasen (3):
      fix up inhibit parameter handling
      fix typo in error name
